# Onboarding New Team Member to the Orange Project

**Project Overview**:  
The *Orange Project* is a software development initiative that is in the early stages of building an API. Our current tech stack includes Python3, FastAPI for building web APIs, and Unit Test for ensuring code quality. As we grow, the tech stack will evolve to accommodate more tools and technologies.

## Resources

To get started, here are the key resources that will guide you through your onboarding and day-to-day tasks:

- **Code Repository**: You can access the codebase through our [Orange Code Repository](https://github.com/jackyhuynh/orange.git). This is where you will contribute code, review pull requests, and collaborate with other developers.
  
- **Kanban Board & Project Roadmap**: Our [Orange Project Board & Roadmap](https://github.com/users/jackyhuynh/projects/6) outlines the tasks that are currently in progress, upcoming work, and long-term goals. You'll use this to track your tasks and check the status of the project.

- **Collaboration Board**: We use a [Orange FigJam Board](https://www.figma.com/board/8ByAhNi4beFyRFRKVSBLH5/Orange-Board?node-id=0-1&t=KdqWDxHU7CWV99aj-1) for brainstorming, discussions, and collaborative design work. This is where you can share ideas, ask for feedback, and contribute to design processes.
