# Storytelling, Backlog and User Personas


Both **backlog** and **storytelling** are crucial to agile project management because they help structure work, define priorities, and keep the development focused on delivering value to the users.

## What is Storytelling?

In the context of software development, **storytelling** refers to the practice of communicating the project's vision, goals, and user needs through well-crafted narratives. Storytelling can be used to create:
- **User Stories**: These are short, simple descriptions of a feature or task written from the perspective of the end user. User stories help the team understand the “why” behind a feature and how it adds value to the user.

**Example of a User Story**:
"As a user, I want to be able to log in to my account using an API, so that I can access personalized information."


Storytelling can also help in:
- **Presenting the Vision**: Helping stakeholders and the team understand the purpose and desired outcomes of the project.
- **Explaining Decisions**: Conveying why certain features are prioritized and how they relate to the users' needs.
- **Building Team Engagement**: Keeping everyone aligned by making the project’s journey and mission relatable.

In short, storytelling in software development is about humanizing the project and using narratives to communicate how features will serve users or how the team will achieve specific goals.

## What is a Backlog?

- A backlog is a list of tasks, features, and improvements that are planned for the project. Each item in the backlog represents a specific piece of work that will be prioritized based on the project roadmap. In the Orange Project, the backlog is managed on our [Kanban Board & Project Roadmap](https://github.com/users/jackyhuynh/projects/6), where you will find tasks organized into categories like “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done.”
- In the context of software development and project management, a **backlog** refers to a prioritized list of tasks, features, or improvements that need to be completed for the project. The backlog acts as a to-do list for the development team, where tasks are organized based on their importance and urgency.

There are two main types of backlogs:
1. **Product Backlog**: A comprehensive list of all features, enhancements, and bug fixes that need to be done over the lifetime of a product. It is typically managed by the Product Owner.
2. **Sprint Backlog**: A subset of the product backlog that contains tasks selected for the current sprint or development cycle.

**Key Characteristics:**
- The items in the backlog are often user stories or tasks.
- It’s a living document, meaning it can be adjusted as the project progresses.
- Items are prioritized so that the most important work gets done first.

**Example**:
For the *Orange Project*, the backlog might contain items like:
- Implement user authentication via FastAPI
- Write unit tests for API endpoints
- Optimize database queries for performance
