# Clear Documentation Writing

## Project Documentation Guidelines

### 1. **Keep It Simple**

- Documentation should be concise, performing **only one function**—providing necessary information. Avoid overwhelming
  readers with excessive detail or multiple topics in a single section.

### 2. **Minimal Onboarding Instructions**

- Assume that developers are familiar with common tools and frameworks. For example, if we use FastAPI, simply mention
  it; there’s no need to explain how to set it up. Developers can find resources online.

### 3. **Avoid Duplication**

- Each piece of information should exist **in one place only**. If something is already explained elsewhere, reference
  that section instead of repeating it. Consistency and clarity should be prioritized.

### 4. **No Embedded Links or Videos**

- **Do not rely on external resources**, such as links or videos, because they can become outdated or removed over time.
  Keep the documentation self-contained.

### 5. **Less is More**

- Excessive documentation can be overwhelming and counterproductive. Be selective with what you include, focusing on **essential tasks** and **key information**.
