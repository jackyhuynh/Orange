# What is a User Personas?

A user persona is a representation of the target audience for whom we are building the Orange Project. These personas are fictional characters based on real data and user research. They help guide the development process by keeping the end user in mind when making design and functionality decisions. 

Our user personas are defined and continually refined based on feedback and research, with a focus on developers needing a fast, reliable, and scalable API.
